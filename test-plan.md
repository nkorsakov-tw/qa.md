# Test Plan unTill Air

----------------

## Rules for Testers

1. **Always Create a Task**:  
   If you encounter a potential error, don't hesitate to create a task. If in doubt, consult the development team for clarification, but generally, a task should be created for every issue you encounter.

2. **Follow Test Plans**:  
   Strictly adhere to the test plan and test cases. But...

3. **Be Creative**:  
   Don't limit yourself to these guidelines; feel free to deviate sometimes from the plan's clauses if it might help uncover issues.

4. **Don't Avoid Rare Scenarios**:  
   Even if an action seems unusual, aim to cover all possible situations. For example, why not try ordering 100 items to see what happens?

5. **Be Skeptical**:  
   Always question the system's behavior and functionality. Approach it like an end-user and try to identify weaknesses.

6. **Be Detail-Oriented**:  
   Pay attention to minor details, as they can sometimes indicate more significant underlying problems.

7. **Verify Fixes**:  
   Never approve a task without re-testing functionalities that have been updated or fixed to ensure they now work as expected.

8. **Comprehensive Descriptions**:  
   When reporting an error, provide a detailed description. Include all essential steps taken, so that the issue can be easily understood and replicated.

9. **Stay in Touch with the Development Team**:  
   Keep track of the tasks you've set. Stay updated on their status, respond promptly to queries or requests from the development team, and don't forget to close tasks that have been resolved.

10. **Add tasks in the Feedback sections:** If you have any kind of suggestions (you should have them), create the tasks in the Feedback gerously.

**Example:**

Create 20 discounts and observe how it will work in the POS. Would the discounts available, how they will be placed in the discount list?
Assign 10 modifiers for one article to check
