# Test Plan (unTill Air)

----------------

## Principles

1. **Always Create a Task**:  
   If you encounter a potential error, don't hesitate to create a task. If in doubt, consult the development team for clarification, but generally, a task should be created for every issue you encounter.

2. **Follow Test Plans**:  
   Strictly adhere to the test plan and test cases. But...

3. **Be Creative**:  
   Don't limit yourself to these guidelines; feel free to deviate sometimes from the plan's clauses if it might help uncover issues.

4. **Don't Avoid Rare Scenarios**:  
   Even if an action seems unusual, aim to cover all possible situations. For example, why not try ordering 100 items to see what happens?

5. **Be Skeptical**:  
   Always question the system's behavior and functionality. Approach it like an end-user and try to identify weaknesses.

6. **Be Detail-Oriented**:  
   Pay attention to minor details, as they can sometimes indicate more significant underlying problems.

7. **Verify Fixes**:  
   Never approve a task without re-testing functionalities that have been updated or fixed to ensure they now work as expected.

8. **Comprehensive Descriptions**:  
   When reporting an error, provide a detailed description. Include all essential steps taken, so that the issue can be easily understood and reproduced. If you understand that there is the need in screenshots for visual representation, take them and attach to the task.

9. **Stay in Touch with the Development Team**:  
   Keep track of the tasks you've set. Stay updated on their status, respond promptly to queries or requests from the development team, and don't forget to close tasks that have been resolved.

10. **Add tasks in the Feedback sections:** If you have any kind of suggestions (you should have them), create the tasks in the Feedback generously (But in general do not set an assignee).


## Scope

You need to test services of unTill Air (Back Office and POS) on two environments (DEV cluster and TEST cluster) and two platforms (IOS and Android).

## Objective

We must highlight the possible errors, bugs etc. before going live. Our aim is to prevent collapses. We work to gurantee the high quality of the Products which we provide to our customers.

## Structure

The structure of this Test Plan mainly is divided into two parts: "Test cases" and "Scenarious". 

- The "Test cases" assume that you need from time to time ensure that the system works as expected and we have no serious issues in our software. So, all common operations in the Back Office and POS should be covered by following these described steps. 

- The "Scenarious" section assumes that the tester composes some rare scenarious to prevent the appearance of the issues, questions, bags which should be then resolved and explained. Based on some scenarious which sometimes help to find the mistake, you can try various approaches to detect an error which isn't obvious and eye-catching. 

The good example of such kind of scenario is the ["Edge case"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case). The essence of this scenario consists in the approach to the testing when you touch the extreme values of the parametres. This approach can be really effective to find the sections in the software product where the objective limits and restrictions take a place but didn't established in the product. This circumstance can be a potencial trouble for clients.
