# Test Plan (unTill Air)

----------------

## 10 Principles

1. **Always Create a Task**:  
   If you encounter a potential error, don't hesitate to create a task. If in doubt, consult the development team for clarification, but generally, a task should be created for every issue you encounter.

2. **Follow Test Plans**:  
   Strictly adhere to the test plan and test cases. But...

3. **Be Creative**:  
   Don't limit yourself to these guidelines; feel free to deviate sometimes from the plan's clauses if it might help uncover issues.

4. **Don't Avoid Rare Scenarios**:  
   Even if an action seems unusual, aim to cover all possible situations. For example, why not try ordering 100 items to see what happens?

5. **Be Skeptical**:  
   Always question the system's behavior and functionality. Approach it like an end-user and try to identify weaknesses.

6. **Be Detail-Oriented**:  
   Pay attention to minor details, as they can sometimes indicate more significant underlying problems.

7. **Verify Fixes**:  
   Never approve a task without re-testing functionalities that have been updated or fixed to ensure they now work as expected.

8. **Comprehensive Descriptions**:  
   When reporting an error, provide a detailed description. Include all essential steps taken, so that the issue can be easily understood and reproduced. If you understand that there is the need in screenshots for visual representation, take them and attach to the task.

9. **Stay in Touch with the Development Team**:  
   Keep track of the tasks you've set. Stay updated on their status, respond promptly to queries or requests from the development team, and don't forget to close tasks that have been resolved.

10. **Add tasks in the Feedback sections:** If you have any kind of suggestions (you should have them), create the tasks in the Feedback generously (But in general do not set an assignee).


## Scope

You need to test services of unTill Air (Back Office and POS) on two environments (DEV cluster and TEST cluster) and two platforms (IOS and Android).

## Objective

1. We must detect the possible errors, bugs etc. before going live. Our aim is to prevent system failures. We work to gurantee the high quality of the Products which we provide to our customers.

2. Additionally, our aim is to suggest significant improvements to the development team to enhance the overall experience for our end clients. Don't approach the product solely as a tester; instead, use it as an end-user would. Identify features or actions that are complicated or non-intuitive. 

So, under these two main objectives, you should:

- Ensure the availability of all features.
- Verify the accuracy of the reports.

## Structure

The structure of this Test Plan mainly is divided into two parts: "Test cases" and "Scenarios". 

- The "Test cases" assume that you need from time to time ensure that the system works as expected and we have no serious issues in our software. So, all common operations in the Back Office and POS should be covered by following these described steps. When you work with "Test cases" you must *follow these steps* and may make something over to find an error. 

- The "Scenarios" section assumes that the tester composes some rare scenarios to prevent the appearance of the issues, questions, bags which should be then resolved and explained. Based on some scenarios which sometimes help to find the mistake, you can try various approaches to detect an error which isn't obvious and eye-catching. When working with the 'Scenarios,' you don't need to follow the provided steps and examples exactly as they are described. Your goal should be to identify potential mistakes. Use your imagination to build upon the given examples and create new scenarios.

The good example of such kind of scenario is the ["Edge case"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case). The essence of this scenario consists in the approach to the testing when you touch the extreme values of the parametres. This approach can be really effective to find the sections in the software product where the objective limits and restrictions take a place but didn't established in the product. This circumstance can be a potencial trouble for clients.

## Edge cases

Try to test the limits of system which can be unconsidered from the developer's side to set appropriate restrictions. The error might appear in the case when you make something unusual and even crazy. 

You can deliberately enter the incorrect information to observe how the system will react on this.

Try to find a complex issue using the unity of other cases. It can be a combination of the 'Error cases', 'Corner cases', and 'Test cases'.

**Extremal values**

- Create 20 discounts and observe how it will work in the POS. Would the discounts available, how they will be placed in the discount list?

- Assign 10 modifiers for one article to check that it will be decently displayed. 

- On the page of the subscriptions, select more than 100 screens. Check which price would be displayed.

**Corner cases**

- Create an order and complete the order and print it tomorrow. Pay attention on the time of the bill ticket and values...

- Apply a discount to not full menu. How the system will react?

**Error values**

- Skip the menu item that isn't allowed to skip. How the system will react?

- Create the period (One-time use values) in the Back Office from 01.01.1975 till 01.10.2009. Have we some intended restrictions in such situations?

- Ehter the incorrect unTill Payments Credentials on the designated page. What would be the response?

- Enter the incorrect IP Address of the printer.

- Enter the incorrect POS User password when you enter to POS application.

**Negative testing**

- You try to overload the system with various types of information. The aim is to input different values that could push the system into unpredictable behavior.

**Special case**

- Skip the menu item that isn't allowed to skip. Apply a discount to not full menu. What is the respond of the system?

In this situation you unify the approaches from the previous cases to reach out a bit more serious issue.
