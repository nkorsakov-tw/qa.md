# Test Plan

## Abstract

This document is prepared to provide guidelines that testers must adhere to in order to systematically optimise the testing of the Payments Portal and the Reseller Portal. This document contains the descriptions of basic approaches in testing that can help you to find the potential error quite more efficient.  

## Introduction

The creation of the document is motivated by [Increase Test Coverage Issue](https://dev.untill.com/projects/#!659377).

### Objectives

1. We must get rid of potential errors before going live. So, the QA team should contribute efforts to warn the development team regarding these areas of error's risks.
2. We should provide not only reports about the errors to the development team but a feedback as well. Look on the product as an end-user and recommend to the development team which particular improvements are required.

### Scope

You must test the Portals on two environments (TEST cluster and DEV cluster) and two platforms (IoS and Android).

### Structure

This Test Plan has a separate structure that included two main sections: "Test cases" and "Edge cases".

- "Test cases" are designed to cover common situations encountered while using the Portals. Testers must follow all guidelines and recommendations to ensure that the system works correctly. The "Test cases" serve as a way to detect and resolve primarily issues corresponding with the basic features. Here we need make sure that all elements work as expected.
- "Edge cases" are designated to test the rare and comlex scenarios which are not come to the mind first while you working with the Portals. In the Test Plan, the approaches and examples of the "Edge cases" are presented but you do not need to follow these options like guidelines, you should keep it in your mind and impress it to make something similar and reach an error in the system.

### Principles

Please refer to the [Test Plan for unTill Air](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JH1KWSJ1TzXFBp-H8c3hTkOsUP_n_cNefsJWcl0mQuA/edit?usp=sharing) that contains the principles and read them.
