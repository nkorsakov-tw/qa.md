# Test Plan

## Abstract

This document is written to provide guidelines that testers must adhere to in order to systematically optimise the testing of the Payments Portal and the Reseller Portal. This document contains the descriptions of basic approaches in testing that can help you to find the potential error quite more efficient.  

## Introduction

The creation of the document is motivated by [Increase Test Coverage Issue](https://dev.untill.com/projects/#!659377).

### Objectives

1. We must eliminate potential errors before going live. Therefore, the QA team should make efforts to alert the development team about areas at risk for errors.
2. We should provide not only error reports to the development team but also feedback. View the product as an end-user and recommend specific improvements to the development team.

### Scope

You must test the Portals on two environments (TEST cluster and DEV cluster) and two platforms (IoS and Android).

### Structure

This Test Plan has a separate structure that included two main sections: "Test cases" and "Edge cases".

- "Test cases" are designed to cover common situations encountered while using the Portals. Testers must follow all guidelines and recommendations to ensure that the system works correctly. The "Test cases" serve as a way to detect and resolve primarily issues corresponding with the basic features. Here we need make sure that all elements work as expected.
- "Edge cases" are designated to test the rare and comlex scenarios which are not come to the mind first while you working with the Portals. In the Test Plan, the approaches and examples of the "Edge cases" are presented but you do not need to follow these options like guidelines, you should keep it in your mind and impress it to make something similar and reach an error in the system.

### Principles

Please refer to the [Test Plan for unTill Air](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JH1KWSJ1TzXFBp-H8c3hTkOsUP_n_cNefsJWcl0mQuA/edit?usp=sharing) that contains the principles and read them.

## Test Cases (Reseller Portal)

### Invitation Process

- Ask a unTill representative with Reseller Admin rights to invite you to the Reseller Portal as either an Air Reseller or Payments Reseller.
- Verify that you've received an email invitation to the Portal, designating you as an Air Reseller.
- Click on the link provided in the email and confirm that it directs you to the correct page (reseller.dev.air.untill.com).
- Make sure the page opens without significant delay and that you can enter the Portal.
- Attempt to initiate processes like inviting a user or switching between sections. The system should prevent these actions.
- The system should then redirect you to the 'Subscription Profile'.
- Unless you complete the 'Subscription Profile,' access to other sections related to Air subscriptions should be restricted.
- Test the same for the Payments Profile. Until you complete this profile, you should be restricted from accessing other unTill Payments-related sections, such as Payments Locations and Payouts.

### Subscriptions

- Switch to the 'Subscriptions' tab and review all titles, headings, and the interface.
- Click on 'Invite User'.
- A unique link to unTill Air should appear immediately.
- Use the provided tool to copy this link.
- Paste this link somewhere and click on it. Verify that it directs you to the unTill Air sign-up page.
- Create an account using this link and subscribe to the location.
- Return to the Reseller Portal.
- Visit the 'Subscription' section and ensure that all data for the user who recently arranged a subscription is correct and all fields are filled in.
- Return to the 'Subscription Profile' and verify that you can modify and add information, as well as remove information (except for the email address).

### Account

If you have a role as Payments Reseller, you can test other sections of the Reseller Portal such as 'Account'.

- Navigate to 'Account'. Review the provided data and check for its accuracy.
- Set different timeframes and monitor how the data changes.
- If you have access to execute payouts, test how this feature reflects in the 'Account' section.
 
### Payments Locations

- Navigate to 'Payments Locations'.
- Click 'Add location'.
- Switch between timezones. Ensure that you can do this.
- When entering the email, you should be prompted for its validity if necessary.
- Set different processing fees and acquirer fees.
- Add another email and confirm that it attaches to the payments location like the primary email.
- Click 'Continue'.
- Confirm that an invitation to the Payments Location was sent to the indicated email.
- Try to modify an existing Payments Location.
- Adjust existing fees and proceed.
- Change the location name and proceed.
- Click 'Invite new users' and confirm the user was added.
- Confirm you can cancel an user invitation by clicking the designated sign.
- Try to resend the invitation to the user and check its functionality.
- Try to delete a payments location at all by clicking the corresponding button. Confirm that you are warned this action could be irreversible.
- If you deleted a Payments Location, confirm it has been removed from the list of Payments Locations.
- Check the values in the list of Payments Locations.

### Payments Profile

- Navigate to 'Payments Profile'.
- Attempt to change the legal name of your incorporated company.
- Confirm the 'Send to Transfer Instrument' functionality is valid.
- Click 'Update profile settings'.
- You will be redirected to the Adyen page.
- Confirm the language matches the one set on the Portal.

**Note:** You are free to compose the information in testing aims on this page.

- Click 'Company details' and enter the required information.
- Click 'Decision-makers' and enter the required information. (The ID can be jyust a random image file).
- Click 'Payout details' and enter the required information. (To do so you need to generate IBAN of the country where you reside).
- Click 'Sign services agreement' using the person that was imagined on the 'Decision-makers' page by you.
- Then you should be able to use cards in the location by setting it in the Back Office.

If you have the ability to test the terminals (If you are equipped by test terminals and test bank cards), follow these steps to activate the terminals and subsequently test the payments functionality of unTill Air.

Specific steps to be able to test terminals working:

1. Navigate to 'Payment methods'.
2. Add a card payment method with a kind of payment - 'card'.
3. Ask the unTill reprentative to link the terminal to your location.
4. Request Payment methods as the payment methods indicated on your test card.
5. Copy the POIID from the 'Terminals' section within the Payments Portal.
6. Add new terminal within the Back Office and input there POIID which was taken from the Payments Portal
7. Assign payment terminal to the screen you use in the POS.

And now you are able to test the process of payment within your Location.

**Note:** Do not confuse the clusters available for testing. If the Payments Portal is used on the DEV cluster - the Back Offcie must be also used on the DEV cluster.

- Order some articles in the location that you linked terminals.
- Pay a bill by the card payment method.
- Make sure that the Process of payment isn't completed until you use the test card to make a payment.
- Make required actions while working with the test terminal.
- Verify that the changes are reflected in the Back Office, in the Reports section for example.
- Verify that the changes are reflected on the Payments Portal because the transaction is passed already.

### Payouts



### Languages

- Switch between several languages.
- Verify that the translation appears.
- Go through the different sections to make sure that the translation is displayed. 

### Logout

- Click 'Logout'.
- Try to log in again. Verify that entire process was passed as expected.

## Test Cases (Payments Portal)

### Request access to unTill Payments

- Navigate to the unTill Payments page in the Back Office.
- Submit a request.
- When you try to submit a request, note that the corresponding signs are appeared in this section.
- Verify that the request was sent successfully (use the Reseller account for this aim).
- Then as a Reseller create a Payments Location on the Reseller Portal, invite there users and verify that the invitation is available and the new users have an access to the Payments Portal for now when they click on link provided in email.
- Verify also the email itself, estimate how many time takes the process of the sending and the receiving email. So if the delay will be longer than expected inform the development team about this issue, it can be a problem.

## Edge cases

To read a theoretical base regarding "Edge cases", [refer to the Test Plan for Back Office and POS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JH1KWSJ1TzXFBp-H8c3hTkOsUP_n_cNefsJWcl0mQuA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Extremal values

This basic approach in the Edge cases assumes the entering of the maximum and minimum values to provocate the possible errors of the system.

#### Examples:

- Try to reach a ceilure of the quantity of Payouts. The system must prevent it and do not allow you to do so until you will be onboarded on the Payments Profile section by clicking 'Update Profile settings' and redirecting to the Adyen Page.

- 

### Corner cases

Try to find the most rare scenarios for users on the Portals.

#### Examples:

- When you are looking for valid subscriptions which are contained in the list of the 'Subscriptions' section where the data regarding Location Owners and their Locations are stored.
